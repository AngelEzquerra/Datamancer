* v0.1.7
- allow assignment of constants in =seqsToDf=
- allow assignment of scalars to DF as column directly
- add filename argument to =showBrowser=
- make =compileFormulaImpl= actually typed to make formulas work
  correctly inside of generics (ref =ggplotnim=
  https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim/issues/116
- change internal macro type logic to use strings
  
* v0.1.6
- fix slicing of constant columns

* v0.1.5
- fully qualify =Value= on scalar formula construction

* v0.1.4
- fix formulas (and type deduction) for certain use cases involving
  =nnkBracketExpr= that are *not* references to columns

* v0.1.3
- improve type deduction capabilities for infix nodes
- add overload for =drop= that doesn't just work on a mutable data
  frame
- fix reference semantics issues if DF is modified and visible in
  result (only data is shared, but columns should be respected)
- =arrange= now also takes a =varargs[string]= instead of a
  =seq=. While there is still a bug of not properly being able to use
  varargs, at least an array is possible (and hopefully at some point
  proper varargs).

* v0.1.2
- CSV parser is more robust, can handle unnammed columns
- explicit types in =idx=, =col= column reference finally works
  (e.g. =idx("foo", float)= accesses the column "foo" as a float
  tensor overwriting type deductions and type hints)

* v0.1.1
- allow =nnkMacroDef= in =findType=
- add development notes and ideas about rewrite of formula macro in =notes/formula_dev_notes.org=

* v0.1.0

- initial version of Datamancer based on =ggplotnim= data frame with
  major formula macro rewrite
