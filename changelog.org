* v0.1.9
- add basic implementation of =spread= (inverse of =gather=; similar
  to dplyr =pivot_wider=). The current implementation is rather basic
  and performance may be suboptimal for very large data frames.
- add =null= helper to create a =VNull Value=
- significantly improve the docs of the =dataframe.nim= module.
- fixes an issue where unique column reference names were combined
  into the same column due to a bad name generation algorithm
- significantly improves performance in applications in which
  allocation of memory is a bottleneck (tensors were zero
  initialized).
- disable formula output at CT by default. Compile with
  =-d:echoFormulas= to see the output.
- remove CT warnings for unrelated stuff (node kinds)  
* v0.1.8
- avoid some object conversions in column operations (ref #11)
- add ~[]=~ overloads for columns for slice assignments
- *significantly* improve performance of =mutate/transmute= operations
  for grouped dataframes (O(150,000) groups in < 0.5 s possible now)
- fixes #12 by avoiding hashing of columns. Some performance
  regression in =innerJoin=, =setDiff= (~2x slower in bad cases).    
* v0.1.7
- allow assignment of constants in =seqsToDf=
- allow assignment of scalars to DF as column directly
- add filename argument to =showBrowser=
- make =compileFormulaImpl= actually typed to make formulas work
  correctly inside of generics (ref =ggplotnim=
  https://github.com/Vindaar/ggplotnim/issues/116
- change internal macro type logic to use strings
  
* v0.1.6
- fix slicing of constant columns

* v0.1.5
- fully qualify =Value= on scalar formula construction

* v0.1.4
- fix formulas (and type deduction) for certain use cases involving
  =nnkBracketExpr= that are *not* references to columns

* v0.1.3
- improve type deduction capabilities for infix nodes
- add overload for =drop= that doesn't just work on a mutable data
  frame
- fix reference semantics issues if DF is modified and visible in
  result (only data is shared, but columns should be respected)
- =arrange= now also takes a =varargs[string]= instead of a
  =seq=. While there is still a bug of not properly being able to use
  varargs, at least an array is possible (and hopefully at some point
  proper varargs).

* v0.1.2
- CSV parser is more robust, can handle unnammed columns
- explicit types in =idx=, =col= column reference finally works
  (e.g. =idx("foo", float)= accesses the column "foo" as a float
  tensor overwriting type deductions and type hints)

* v0.1.1
- allow =nnkMacroDef= in =findType=
- add development notes and ideas about rewrite of formula macro in =notes/formula_dev_notes.org=

* v0.1.0

- initial version of Datamancer based on =ggplotnim= data frame with
  major formula macro rewrite
